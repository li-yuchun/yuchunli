            Title: Integrate service experience of the Copenhagen harbour area </br>

            Date: 2018.02-2018.05 [4 months]

            <p>
              “CPH Harbour Explorer” is a service platform with interactive boards at bus stops and web apps where event organizers can promote their events. 
              It connects users to events and places around the Copenhagen harbour by using the harbour bus. From the holistic perspective, 
              it helps to disperse the flow of people across all the harbour destinations from the central ones and avoids the congestion. 
              From the users’ perspective, it offers a more integrated experience and gives them easy access information to better plan their trips.

            </p>
            
            <p>
              My major tasks and responsibilities covered creating research framework, analyzing & visualizing data, 
              developing service concepts, creating initial UI, and testing the concept with stakeholders. 
              I collaborated with four service designers to deliver the project.

                  <h4>Finding initial direction for the research</h4>

                  <p>At the beginning of the project, we got the topic “Urban Mobility”. 
                    As the topic is broad without a clear design brief,
                    we started to share our own experience related to mobility in the group and use mind maps to map out the possibilities around the topic. 
                    The activity aims to achieve the consensus within the group and to find the initial research focus.

                    To find out the real problems in the mobility system,

                  <h4>Interviewing with neighborhood residents</h4>
                  <p>
                    We selected residents who lived in Sydhavn to start our user research because of the district’s close proximity to us, 
                    which allowed us to conduct a thorough and quick research to collect the issues related to the social element and mobility. 
                    To sparkle the conversation between users and better relate to the topic, we used a map with open questions to guide the user’s focus around mobility.
                    The main finding from the interview showed the difficulty of citizens in Sydhavn to move to other regions in Copenhagen and their positive experience around the harbour. 
                    It drove us to investigate the experience around the harbour further.

                  <p>
                    To discover new perspectives on the problems around harbour and understand the travel experience for the passengers of using water transportation, 
                    we conducted contextual interviews on the harbour bus to gather the most realistic user experience.
                    
                    We used a map of Sydhavn and asked four passengers to pinpoint their location in terms of work/home and to learn about their current harbour bus experience.

                  <p>To gather more users’ behavior and their patterns for using the harbour bus, 
                    we conducted the structured interview and invited users on the harbour bus. 

                    The topics covered users’ individual journeys, the goals of the trip, demographic data, 
                    and other comments related to the current service experience.

                  <h4>The struggle of gathering data turned into new ways of investigation</h4>

                  <p>As a part of the semester curriculum, we participated in a workshop regarding scrapping and disseminating data from Twitter and Instagram. 
                    During the workshop, we generated a curated list of keywords related to our research scope. 

                    However, when we searched the social activities in our research area, 
                    it showed no significant engagements on the map. 
                    This missing data was a sign of lacking social engagement in our research scope and the urgent need to gather data by investigating other sources. 
                    
                  </p>

                  <h4>Understanding stakeholders’ needs in the mobility system</h4>

                  <p>To better understand the Copenhagen harbour area’s mobility, we interviewed various main stakeholders 
                    (Team Mobilitet, Visit Copenhagen, Copenhell, Distortion island, Kulturhavn). 
                    Their main responsibilities covered transportation, tourism, and event facilitation.

                    Defined target users</h4>
                  <p>
                    From previous user study, we identified three main user groups in the current service system. 
                    It helped the design team to have a mutual understanding of who we were designing for, 
                    ensuring that the new service tackled the right needs. 
                    The target users we were focusing on were A) Spontaneous explorers and B) Tourists explorers

                  <p> 
                    We used a value proposition map to bridge the define and concept creation phase. 
                    It helped to connect the specific user needs and wants that we discovered from 
                    our user research with the components of the new service.

                    To envision the interactions between the physical touchpoint (the interactive board) 
                    in the service concept, we used arduino to create a prototype.

                  <p>
                    The prototype included speakers, LED lamps for visualizing new audio messages and buttons to play the audio messages.
                    This prototype was used to test the idea with stakeholders.

                  <p>My learnings for overcoming the challenge in the project and reflection of the design process</p>
                  
                    <h4>Main challenge</h4> 
                    
                    <p>
                      The project team was composed of five team members with similar interests. 
                      It was extremely challenging to coordinate and distribute the tasks equally. 
                      To overcome this challenge, we periodically arranged short meetings to transparently share our experience in the group, 
                      adjust the workload to fit our own schedules, and give feedback on each other. 
                      Through the project, we also used Trello and Slack to efficiently support the remote and collaborative work. 
                      At the end of the project, we were the only group with five members who managed to deliver a good performance on time.

                   </p>
               
                    <h4>Reflection and further improvement</h4> 
                    <p>
                      After reviewing the design process, there were two aspects that I think 
                      I could have done better and improved the quality of this project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      First, to develop a feasible business model for the new service. 
                      Even though the service concept was welcomed by many stakeholders and users, 
                      it was not clear how the revenue was generated through the new service system. 
                      By proposing a more practical business model, it would help to validate the motivations of stakeholders 
                      in the new system and also to move this project further into practice.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Second, to conduct the competitive analysis. After the service concept was formed, 
                      it would be interesting to look into other digital solutions for planning trips and events in the market. 
                      This could help to better position our service in the big picture and create novel features for better user experience.
